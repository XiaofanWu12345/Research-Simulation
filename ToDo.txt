• Redo the paper simulations
	More points in heavy traffic
	Include MSMW-log as well
	Both 3 queue and 2*2. Note that in 3 queue case, MSMW is identical to MSMW-log
• Exploring newer algorithms in 3 queue case
	? Compare MaxWt, PriE and the new Algo 2 and Algo 3
• Do the simulation for a 3*3 and bigger switches
• Plotting Sample paths and the cone
• PURA grant proposal
	See the performance paper
				
Done:

• Mckeown Paper - 
	? For the 3 queue case and [1/2,1/2,1/2], compare
		§ MaxWt
		§ MaxSize_PriMaxWt
		§ Pri_E
		§ MaxSize_Random
		
• Can you improve MaxWeight by breaking ties carefully?
			I guess not
